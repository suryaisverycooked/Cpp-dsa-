>> switch is used usually for menu driven programs, coupled with an infinite loop.
switch(choice){
    case 1:
            ------
            break;
    case 2:
            ------
            break;
    default:
            -------
}
can escape the loop with exit(0).

->> functions are reusable blocks of code that can be used for code reducibility and readability.
int Max(int x, int y){
    if x>y
        return x;
    else
        return y;
}
int  main(){
    take two inputs a and b;
    Max(a,b);
    Max(c,d);
    -
    -
    -
}

->> PasS by value:

void print(int a++){
    cout<<a<<endl;
}
int main()
{
    print(b);
    cout<<b<<endl;
}

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
void print(int a){
    a++;
    cout<<a<<endl;
}
int main()
{
    int b;
    cout<<"Enter a number: ";
    cin>>b;
    print(b);
    cout<<b<<endl;
}

The output will be (lets say b =7) we get 8 7 , this is because when we call a function and pass a value to it a copy of the called
function is created and changes are only made there and hence changes as a++ is only visible in the called function and is not
updated in the main function. in main b will be 7 and for the function called b will be 8.

->> PasS by reference:
When the address/index of the memory block is passed in the called function then both the functions main and the called function
will have the changes as the address is being manipulated.
