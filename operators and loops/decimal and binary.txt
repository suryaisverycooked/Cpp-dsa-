computers convert to decimal to binary for it to understand the instruction
but breaking down the conversion we have:
    Ex- 7
    binary is either 0 or 1 so it can hold only 2 values.
    we divide 7 with 2 and store the remainder until the original number(7)becomes 0 and then reverse the stored remainder to get
    binary.
    which works like this
                         division:   7/2 -> 3/2 -> 1/2 -> 0
                         remainder:   1      1      1
                         reversing this we get 111 which is 7 in binary
in pprogram code
we save remainder as bit = n%2

#include <iostream>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
            int n,i=0;
            int digit, answer=0;
            cout<<"Enter the value of N: ";
            cin>>n;
            while(n!=0){
                    int bit = n%2;
                    answer = bit*(pow(10,i)) + answer;
                    n=n/2;
                    i++;
            }
            cout<<answer;
}
and to store answer we do bit*pow(10,i) + answer ( i is initially 0)
so for 7 it woild be 111 but to reverse and store it we do 1 * 10^0 + 0 = 1
then again answer = 1*10 + 1 = 11
then finally answer = 1*10^2 + 11 = 

*** right shift operator is liking dividing again n again by 2 >>
*** left shift operator is like multiplying with powers of 2 <<

for binary to decimal-
we can make use of the left shift operator
